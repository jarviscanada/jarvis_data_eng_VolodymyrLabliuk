# Volodymyr Labliuk . Jarvis Consulting

I have been programming for the last 5 years and during this time I managed to get a programmer qualification at Seneca College and experience in developing dynamic applications using modern approaches and programming languages, and still continue to develop my skills in the application of the latest technologies. I am highly motivated, committed and creative. I am passionate about Computer Science and Information Technology, about building software. I am a keen learner. I have been on Presidents Honour List at Seneca college awarded for outstanding achievement in studies for three semesters and have average GPA 3.9 upon graduation.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This project leverages Bash scripting and Docker to create and manage a system monitoring solution. The goal is to collect and store system information and resource usage in a PostgreSQL database. The users of this project are system administrators or anyone interested in monitoring and analyzing hardware specifications and usage over time. Key technologies used include Bash scripting for data collection, Docker for containerization, and PostgreSQL for data storage.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/sql)]: In this project I set new data base using Docker and PSQL. Main task was to perform different types of queries (DDL and DML) and store that data in VM drive.

**Java Grep** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: I developed Java application that scans directory and it's subdirectories recursively and find all matches with Regex provided in all files. Application accepts three arguments Regex, root directory, output file. JAR file generated, dockerized and pushed to Docker Hub for further use.

**Java Stock Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/core_java/jdbc)]: Application to buy and sell stock shares based on actual data from API

**Java Trading App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/core_java/springboot)]: This application is built using Java Spring Boot and REST API. It interacts with the IEX Quote API to retrieve financial data, which can then be saved, updated, or used to buy and sell stock shares, with the quantities tracked in a database. The application is thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests, dockerized for containerized deployment, and stored in Docker Hub.

**JavaScript and TypeScript coding** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/JavaScript_TypeScript)]: This project aims to practice coding in TypeScript. As part of the process, I developed a doubly linked list, adhering to core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

**Java Springboot application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/springboot)]: This project is a Java-based application for managing trading accounts, securities, and market data. It includes features for creating and managing traders, accounts, quotes, security orders, and positions. It allows you to buy and sell shares by making API calls to different endpoints.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VolodymyrLabliuk/tree/master/python_data_analytics)]: The idea of this project is to built pipeline from CSV file Jupyter notebook in order to perform different analytical oprations. I used Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to manipulate records in DataFrame persorm different calculations and visualize data as Graphs and Curves.


## Highlighted Projects
**NHL stats tracker** [[GitHub](https://github.com/vlabliuk/nhl-stats-app)]: Application allows users to track NHL Live statics, player and roster information. Application uses it's own server that process data written on NodeJS.
